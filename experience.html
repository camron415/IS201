                        <p>I am an individual who has shared in many diverse and unique life experiences. Among these experiences, I have learned the most important attributes and skills that are needed in today's world. </p>
                        <p>My life's experience may be very different from those of my peers. I like to believe that the most important thing is that everyone has their own life experiences that set them apart from everyone else.</p>
                        <p>My life has been nothing short of mindblowing lifechanging experiences that have shaped me to become the person I am today. I am looking forward to gain more experiences with my future employers.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Mission</h2>
                        <p>When I turned 18 I decided to serve a mission for my church. I was assigned to serve in the Chile Viña del Mar mission for two years. There I learned many important life lessons such as how to bond with people of a completely different culture and background.</p>
                        <p>I also learned a very important skill which is to speak Spanish. I found it to be very challenging in the beggining. After several months of practice and making mistakes, I began to finally see some improvements.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The best experiences that one can gain are those experiences that leave their life changed.</blockquote>
                        <p>I have learned so much from my mission. After two years, I have finally been able to feel comfortable speaking in Spanish and conversing with people of different cultures and backgrounds.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Boy Scounts of America</h2>
                        <p>Ever since I turned 11, I joined the Boy Scouts of America. I attended scouts from the age of 11 all the way until I turned 17 and during those long six years, I was able to learn many life lessons about how to survive in the wild, how to support a family and their needs, how to cook, etc.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/photo-1513023840371-dd774fcaee5b.webp" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>Some of my favorite experiences from scouts where when we would go on campouts and adventure in the great outdoors. There were so many animals and so many bugs. However, I found that they were some of the best experiences that I had as a kid.</p>
                        <p>After six years, I had learned how to work hard and endure to the end. The moment I had finished scouts, I felt like a man. I think that this program is very important for every young man looking for meaning and purpose in life.</p>
